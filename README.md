RiskEngine
==========

A comprehensive, on-chain risk assessment and monitoring smart contract for lending protocols. The **RiskEngine** system provides a robust, real-time framework to evaluate and mitigate lending risks by assessing borrower creditworthiness, collateral health, market volatility, and protocol-wide systemic metrics. It's designed to ensure protocol stability, prevent liquidation cascades, and maintain safe lending operations in dynamic decentralized finance (DeFi) environments.

Features
--------

-   **Borrower Creditworthiness:** On-chain credit scoring based on default history and collateral utilization.

-   **Collateral Health Assessment:** Real-time evaluation of collateral value, volatility, and liquidity.

-   **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Calculation:** Dynamic LTV calculation to ensure positions are adequately collateralized.

-   **Real-Time Risk Scoring:** A multi-factor risk score for each lending position and the protocol as a whole.

-   **Protocol-Wide Risk Monitoring:** A sophisticated engine that assesses systemic risk indicators like aggregate LTV, collateral concentration, and protocol utilization.

-   **Liquidation Engine:** A system for detecting at-risk positions and predicting potential liquidation volume and cascade probability.

-   **Stress Testing:** The ability to simulate market crash scenarios and assess protocol resilience.

-   **Correlation Analysis:** On-chain correlation and contagion risk assessment to identify interconnected risks.

-   **Emergency Mode:** Automated risk mitigation triggers, including the potential for an emergency mode to stabilize the protocol during extreme market events.

Technical Details
-----------------

The contract is written in **Clarity**, a decidable, secure, and human-readable smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain. The architecture is modular, with private functions handling core calculations and public functions exposing key functionalities for governance and external integrators.

### Core Components

-   **`constants`**: Defines key risk parameters and error codes.

    -   `MAX-LTV-RATIO`: The maximum allowable loan-to-value ratio (e.g., 80%).

    -   `LIQUIDATION-THRESHOLD`: The LTV at which a position becomes eligible for liquidation (e.g., 85%).

    -   `HIGH-RISK-THRESHOLD`: A protocol risk score that triggers alerts and potential emergency actions.

-   **`data maps` and `vars`**: Stores all persistent state data.

    -   `borrower-profiles`: Maps a borrower's principal address to their detailed credit and position data.

    -   `collateral-assets`: Stores real-time price, volatility, and risk metrics for each supported collateral asset.

    -   `lending-positions`: Tracks individual loan positions, including borrowed amounts, collateral, and health factors.

-   **`private functions`**: Internal helper functions that perform core business logic.

    -   `calculate-health-factor`: Determines the health of a loan position, with a lower health factor indicating a higher risk of liquidation.

    -   `assess-volatility-risk`: Assesses the risk of a single asset based on its price volatility.

    -   `calculate-credit-score`: Computes a borrower's credit score based on their on-chain history.

-   **`public functions`**: The entry points for external interaction.

    -   `register-borrower`: Allows the contract owner to onboard new borrowers.

    -   `update-asset-price`: An oracle-controlled function to update asset data.

    -   `assess-borrowing-risk`: A primary function for evaluating a new or existing borrowing request.

    -   `execute-protocol-wide-risk-monitoring-engine`: The main risk monitoring engine that runs a comprehensive, multi-factor analysis of the entire protocol's health.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

-   Clarity smart contract development environment.

-   Stacks wallet.

-   Stacks CLI for deployment.

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/RiskEngine.git`

2.  Navigate to the contract directory: `cd RiskEngine`

3.  Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain using your preferred method (e.g., Stacks CLI, Clarinet).

### Usage

The contract's main functionality is exposed through its public functions.

Code snippet

```
;; Register a new borrower
(contract-call? 'SP2J6RYPZ61K8P5K9DEXR7T82A2H4P4H4Y5JGY1C.risk-engine register-borrower
  (principal 'SP1C2W3D4E5F6G7H8I9J0K1L2M3N4O5P6Q7R8S9T.borrower-a))

;; Update the price and volatility of a collateral asset
(contract-call? 'SP2J6RYPZ61K8P5K9DEXR7T82A2H4P4H4Y5JGY1C.risk-engine update-asset-price
  "STX" u200 u10)

;; Assess the risk of a new lending position
(contract-call? 'SP2J6RYPZ61K8P5K9DEXR7T82A2H4P4H4Y5JGY1C.risk-engine assess-borrowing-risk
  (principal 'SP1C2W3D4E5F6G7H8I9J0K1L2M3N4O5P6Q7R8S9T.borrower-a)
  "STX" u1000 u2000)

;; Execute the protocol-wide risk monitoring engine
(contract-call? 'SP2J6RYPZ61K8P5K9DEXR7T82A2H4P4H4Y5JGY1C.risk-engine execute-protocol-wide-risk-monitoring-engine
  true true true u10)

Security
--------

This smart contract has undergone extensive internal review and testing. However, as with any smart contract, it is highly recommended to conduct a third-party security audit before deploying to a mainnet environment.

### Security Best Practices

-   **Owner Control:** Critical functions like `register-borrower` and `update-asset-price` are restricted to the `CONTRACT-OWNER` to prevent unauthorized changes to the system's core parameters.

-   **Input Validation:** The contract uses `asserts!` to validate inputs and prevent common vulnerabilities like integer overflows and logical errors.

-   **Error Handling:** A comprehensive set of error codes provides clear feedback on why a transaction failed.

-   **Oracle Dependence:** The system relies on a trusted oracle (`update-asset-price`) for external data. The security and reliability of this oracle are paramount to the protocol's integrity.
